                        I am a Computer Application graduate with a strong foundation in software development, data
                        structures, and object-oriented programming.
                        I specialize in Java-based backend development and web technologies. My passion lies in writing
                        clean, maintainable code and building scalable applications.
                        I am actively seeking an entry-level Software Engineer role where I can contribute and grow.
